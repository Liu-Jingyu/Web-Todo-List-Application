# Web-Todo-List-Application
## Read Me

This is a To-do List Application which is implemented with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and MongoDB.

**It's live here**: https://floating-sierra-46863.herokuapp.com/

It can be host on localhost:3000 and the above link both.

You can add new items and click the "plus" buttom, then the new To-do List will be displayed.

If you want to delete some item, just check the checkbox before this item, then this item will be deleted!


If you host it locally, you can create your own To-do List title by changing the **customlist** in localhost:3000/**customList** to anything you want.
The default title is "Today", for example, you can create a "Jhon's shopping list" by searching localhost:3000/Jhon's shopping list.

Also lodash was implemented. When you go back to search some list, you don't need to care the words you type is in lowercase or in highercase.
For example, if you want to go back to see the "Jhon's shopping list" that you created before, it's ok to search localhost:3000/JHON's SHOPPING list
